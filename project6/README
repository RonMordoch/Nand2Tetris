Remarks
------------
In this exercise we implemented the Assembler program using Python.
We decided to use Python due to the simplicity of Python's text & file handling and parsing abilities.
We followed the HACK specification language found in the book for the translation of asm commands into hack code.
We implemented the Assembler in a different way than the suggested API due to Python's mechanisms. We felt
that we did not need specific classes for menial tasks and that a single function can parse the file, and handle each
line separately.
