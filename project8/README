Remarks
------------
In this exercise we finally completed writing the VMtranslator.
We followed the description and pseudo-code described in the book as our instructions on how to write the goto commands,
call commands, return commands, and the code necessary for function and labels.
We used a counter of the current function being processed in order to distinguish return labels from each other.
