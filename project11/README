Remarks
------------
Hello and welcome to our project 11.

We implemented the project using the suggested implementation including the Symbol table, VMWriter
compilation engine and Jack compiler.

For each module we closely followed the details in the book, regarding the API.

For the compilation engine , we used the same basic structure as we used in the previous project,
but we added the push/pop/call etc. as described in the book/lectures instead of the code for writing
XML code. However, the basic recursive structure remained the same and so the previous project's module
gave us a backbone for implementing this projects compilation engine.
