Project 2 

Submitted Files
------------
HalfAdder.hdl - Performs the addition of 2 bits
FullAdder.hdl - Performs the addition of 3 bits using the previously implemented HalfAdder chip
Add16.hdl - Performs addition of 2 16-bits numbers using HalfAdder and FullAdder
Inc16.hdl - Increments the number by 1
ALU.hdl - Arithmetic Logic Unit implementation, performs all the arithmetic operations 
ShiftLeft.hdl - Performs an arithmetic left shift
ShiftRight.hdl - Performs an arithmetic right shift
Mul.hdl - Performs binary multiplication
LogicShiftLeft.hdl - A helper chip for binary multiplication, created and implemented by us ! :) 

Remarks
------------
We implemented HalfAdder and ShiftLeft using the minimal gates required.
For the Mul chip, we created another chip - the LogicShiftLeft chip, which performs 
a left shift without ignoring the sign bit.
Then we implemented binary multiplication using the Shift-Add algorithm.
